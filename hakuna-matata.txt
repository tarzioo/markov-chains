Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, baby, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time.
